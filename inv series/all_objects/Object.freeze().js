// The Object.freeze() static method freezes an object. Freezing an object prevents extensions
//  and makes existing properties non-writable and non-configurable. 
// A frozen object can no longer be changed: new properties cannot be added,
//  existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability, configurability, writability, 
// or value cannot be changed, and the object's prototype cannot be re-assigned. freeze() returns the same object that was passed in.

const obj = {
    prop: 42,
  };
  
  Object.freeze(obj);
  
  obj.prop = 33;
  // Throws an error in strict mode
  
  console.log(obj.prop);
  // Expected output: 42
